## Schema

### Required

- **host** (String) The host url where influxDB2 lives. Can also be set using the `INFLUX_HOST` environment variable.
- **token** (String, Sensitive) An auth token that has the nesecary permissions to read-from and/or write-to InfluxDB2. Ideally this should be set using the `INFLUX_TOKEN` environment variable, so that the secret is not saved to source control.
